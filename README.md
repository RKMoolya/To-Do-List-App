# To-Do-List-App
The main goal of this project is to build a simple To-Do List application that helps manage daily tasks. It allows adding new tasks, editing them, marking them as complete, deleting them, and even filtering tasks based on their status. I created this project to improve my understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and local storage.
